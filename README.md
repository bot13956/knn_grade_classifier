# knn_grade_classifier
We build a machine learning algorithm using knn classifier for multiclass classification of student test scores. The test scores consist of five features that describe the different categories of assessment that contributes to the final grade:

CQ: canvas quiz 

HW: homework

AT: attendance credit

UT: unit test

FE: final exam

The corresponding labels are the overall letter grade: A, B, C, D, F

data.csv: contains the training dataset

analysis.ipynb: contains code that implements the knn-classifier algorithm
